Growing Object-Oriented Software by Test Driven Development.


## Intents

- Learning Test Driven Software Development.
- Where we having to backtrack on decisions that turn out to be wrong.
- Learning to make substantial changes to the code in small, safe steps.


## Preparing to Work

- generate a long requirements via the discussions.
- slice up the functionality so that it can be built a little at a time in incremental development.
   - each slice should be significant and concrete enough.
   - each slice should be small enough to be focused on one concept and available quickly.
- the user can prioritizing the **user stories** / **features**.
- the order of each slice can be adjusted we as go along.
